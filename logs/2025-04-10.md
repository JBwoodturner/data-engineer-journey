## What I studied today
- Completed my firs python exercise in python-daily-drill, about variables
- I set up 60% of my dataCamp profile, and linked it wit my GitHub pipeline repo.

##  Challenges
- I struggle with python fluency.


##  To review
- Keep making python drill exercises on variables and cleaning data

##  Tools used
- csv module, io.StringIO, try - exept, cleaning data
- csv.Dictreader()

##  Time spent
- Time is short — only **1.5 hours in the morning** and **30 minutes in the evening** — but I keep showing up. I’m trying to **open many doors at once**, slowly and consistently. This is the first step, and I trust that the little I do today lays the path for much more tomorrow.

##  Reflections

Veritas est adequatio rei et intellectus; et secundum hoc est in mente, secundum quod apprehendit rem ut est. Sed in mente divina est maxime veritas, quia eius intellectus est causa rerum; et ideo veritas in mente nostra est conformitas ad mentem divinam, sicut exemplatum ad exemplarem.

Truth is the conformity of the mind to reality; and in this sense, it exists in the mind insofar as it grasps things as they are. But truth exists most perfectly in the divine mind, because God’s intellect is the cause of things. Therefore, truth in our minds is a conformity to the divine mind, just as a copy conforms to its exemplar.
