## Log for today 2025-05.21

Today I practiced how to handle paths using `pathlib`. Making the script portable (executable from any directory) is a good habit to develop in my scripts.

I struggled with time today: the exercise was meant to be completed in 30 minutes, but it took me an hour—and I still didn’t finish it. I wanted to understand each step thoroughly.

Today is another step towards becoming a Data Engineer.
