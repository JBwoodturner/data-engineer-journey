## 📘 Data Engineering Journey Log — *April 22, 2025*

**Status**: Returned after a focused period of project work.  
**Main Focus**: Finishing and refining my **Classic Book ETL Pipeline** (📚 *Imitatio Christi*), now moving into a short **Aeneid ETL practice project**.  
**Mood**: Reflective, motivated, and spiritually grounded during Eastertide.

---

### ✅ Completed:
- Finished the **Classic Book ETL pipeline**.
- Manually aligned and cleaned the verses; results stored locally.
- Built a SQL database for this project (still local).
- Learned a lot about Python scripting, HTML parsing, and TSV data handling.

---

### 🛠️ In Progress:
- **Short Aeneid ETL project** (Book I): for practicing making the ETL *playable* in **GitHub Codespaces**.
  - Purpose: Get a feel for pipeline execution environments.
  - Goal: Prepare for future Docker containerization.
- Exploring connection between Codespaces and SQL (possibly using SQLite or Postgres).
- Preparing to upload the *Imitatio Christi* TSV data into **AWS S3**, then querying with **Athena**.
  - First step: Upload TSV to S3 and set up Athena schema.
  - Objective: Practice SQL in a cloud context using my own meaningful data.

---

### 📚 Learning Focus:
- **Python fluency**: Daily drills, focusing on data engineering scripts.
- **ETL orchestration basics**: How to chain scripts, pass data, and log output.
- **Cloud tools**: Light exploration of AWS S3 and Athena.
- **Future plan**: Dockerize a pipeline when I'm ready.

### 🕊️ Easter Reflections & Spiritual Anchor:

“Mors ubi est victoria tua? Resurrexit qui pendebat in ligno!”

“Death, where is your victory? He has risen who hung upon the tree!”
