### MEDITATION

“Tantum aliquis proficit in hoc studio, quantum sibi ipsi violentiam intulerit.”

“One makes progress in study only insofar as one does violence to oneself.”

        — Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard (Super Sent., Prol., q.1 a.3 ad 5)

Discipline of the will and senses — overcoming laziness, distraction, comfort-seeking, and even the desire for quick results.

He’s speaking from the monastic and scholastic tradition, where:
	•	Study is not casual; it is ascetic — like a spiritual exercise.
	•	One must train the intellect the way an athlete trains the body.
	•	This involves “violence” against passions, pride, impatience, and the comfort of ignorance.
