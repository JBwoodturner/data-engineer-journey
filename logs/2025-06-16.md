## Log for today monday 2025-06-10

Many things happened since my last data engineer journey log.

I have three portfolio projects to show, but I neet to finish and polish them.
The learning curve is steep, but the path is clear, and the motivation
is still strong.

I'm considering the possibility of a tech retreat in Krakow: three months
of focused work, shaping myself and preparing to become a hireable candidate.

## What I learned today.

- I'm studying DataCamp introduction to Docker.
- General teachings about images and containers


Laus Deo Honor et Gloria!
