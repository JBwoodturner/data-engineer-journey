## ✨ Reflections

“Qui bene interrogat, 
    bene proficit.
Discere non est onerare mentem, 
    sed accendere lumen.
In silentio studii cor erigitur ad sapientiam quae deorsum non venit.”


“He who asks well, learns well.
To study is not to burden the mind, 
but to kindle a flame.
In the silence of study, 
the heart is lifted toward wisdom that does not come from below.”
