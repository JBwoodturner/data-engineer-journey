## 📘 What I studied today afternoon

- Reviewed the **star schema** structure: fact and dimension tables.
- Understood the role of **dimension tables** in providing descriptive context.
- Explored how **fact tables** record measurable events (e.g., sales).
- Learned how to **normalize** a star schema into a **snowflake schema**.
- Applied these concepts to a book sales example (books, stores, time).
- Understood benefits of normalization: reduces redundancy, improves structure.


## ✨ Reflections

“Qui bene interrogat, 
    bene proficit.
Discere non est onerare mentem, 
    sed accendere lumen.
In silentio studii cor erigitur ad sapientiam quae deorsum non venit.”


“He who asks well, learns well.
To study is not to burden the mind, 
but to kindle a flame.
In the silence of study, 
the heart is lifted toward wisdom that does not come from below.”
