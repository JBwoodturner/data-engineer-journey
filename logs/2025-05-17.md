## What I studied today
- Count files in a folder using Python.
- Count files in sql per extension, showing the percentage of total

## Key takeaways
- Making progress with python. Workrd wit Path from pathlib, and counter from       collections.
- Created a table in sql, and made a nice window view to get the percentace of each file's occurrence.
