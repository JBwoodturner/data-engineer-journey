Today I dedicated most of my time to working on the ClassicBook ETL pipeline. 
For technical details, Iâ€™ve logged everything in that projectâ€™s own log.

Although I didnâ€™t advance in the *Python Crash Course* today, Iâ€™m satisfied with my progress. 
Each step in the ETL pipeline feels meaningful, and I can see the project coming together. 
Staying focused on this project is helping me stay motivated, even if some days are slower than expected.

Grateful to be moving forwardâ€”one piece at a time.
