**Status:** Back to study after a short holiday break.

## Today's Focus

Today marks a fresh return to building the first version of the **Supplier Data Pipeline**. The goal is not just to complete a project, but to learn how to write **professional, reusable, and readable Python scripts** — aiming for fluency rather than copy-paste reliance.

---

## Accomplishments

- Reviewed how to **read `.csv` files** using `pandas`.
- Practiced proper handling of **file paths** using Python’s `pathlib` module.
- Ensured scripts are **runnable from any directory**, improving the flexibility and reusability of the code.
- Committed to learning **script-building from scratch**, by understanding and writing code manually — not just replicating tutorials.

## Reflections

Coming back from holidays, motivation is mixed: there’s both a fresh desire to progress and a bit of struggle to restart momentum. But this project isn’t just about reaching a finish line — it’s about transforming into someone who can confidently and independently build pipelines, understand the tools, and think like a data engineer.
