# April 2, 2025 – Daily Log

## Summary
- Worked through Chapter 5 of *Python Crash Course* 
  (Exercise 5-3).
- Practiced `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements 
  using the "alien color" example.
- Created variations of the solution 
  using user input, `.lower()`, `for` loops, and `time.sleep()` for timed output.
- Created a new GitHub repository 
  to store all work from *Python Crash Course*.
- Pushed today’s code to GitHub successfully.
- Troubleshot VS Code CLI issue 
  (`code` not working from terminal); 
 fixed it by reinstalling VS Code.

## Reflections
- Gained fluency with conditionals and user input.
- Confident in pushing changes via Git a
  nd using GitHub Codespaces.
- Tomorrow: Continue with Chapter 5 (Exercise 5-4), 
  update this log earlier, and practice compound conditions (`and`, `or`).
