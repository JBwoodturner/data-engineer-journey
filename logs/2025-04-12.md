##   Reflections

- Today I decided to log into this data-engineering-journey once a week,
so I can stay focused on my other projects without losing momentum here.

- My main project right now is the classicbook-etl-pipeline, and I hope to start and complete two additional major repositories, along with two smaller ones, to cover the core areas of Data Engineering.

- I'm truly excited about this journey I began two months ago. I give thanks to God, who has granted me the strength, clarity, and discipline to make steady progress so far.
