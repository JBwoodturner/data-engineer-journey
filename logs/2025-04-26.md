# Data Engineer Journey Log — April 26, 2025

###  Summary of the Week:

This week, I made an important decision:  
to start a new portfolio project, the Supplier Data Pipeline,  
with the clear intention of being more organized and deliberate than in my previous repository (classicbook-etl-pipeline).

Unlike before, this time I am committing to a step-by-step approach:  
- Building three versions of the project, gradually increasing the complexity.
- Avoiding rushing; focusing instead on depth, clarity, and strong foundations.

###  Project Planning and Setup:

- I set up a new GitHub repository: `supplier-data-pipeline`.
- I carefully created the initial folder structure (`extract/`, `transform/`, `load/`, `sql/`, `data/`).
- I renamed the Git branch from `master` to `main`, following modern Git standards.
- I configured my Notion app to create a Daily Roadmap Tracker,  
  laying out the next six weeks of structured study and project building.

  - Weeks 1–2: Focused on Version 1 (building the basic ETL pipeline).
  - Weeks 3–4: Expanding into Version 2 (adding enhancements and improvements).
  - Weeks 5–6: Completing Version 3 (integrating cloud services and optimizations).

###  Source of Data:

The real-world data I will be working with consists of CSV reports from my workplace.  
They are monthly reports from the cooperative union — an association managing purchasing for many suppliers.  
These reports manage records of supplier expenses, tracking:

- The amount of money spent on each supplier this year.
- The amount spent during the same month of the previous year.
- Percentage changes and purchasing trends across suppliers.

Thus, this dataset provides a real business context,  
making the project richer and much closer to real-world data engineering work.

###  Personal Reflections:

I am excited about this new stage of my learning process.  
I feel that I am building a strong, orderly foundation for my future career as a Data Engineer.
