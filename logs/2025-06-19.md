It's been almost six months since I started this wonderful journey.
In 2025-01-20 I subscribed to Data Camp and started exploring the word of Data.
Very soon I realized I has a passion for building systems and focused on
Data Engineering, and ETL processes. Since then I'm making progress in parallel:
 in Pyhton scripting, data manipulation with Pandas, Bash fluency, 
Git and GitHub fluency, of course SQL, even a bit of S3, and now Docker. 
 
I'm ready for a three month sprint before my three months retreat in Krakow.
Prepared a Notion template with the subjects I need to cover, and the courses I need to finish before my retreat.

I'm ready to keep going, motivated, alive, excited. Anytime i fight against
difficulties I'm becoming a stroger and resilient man.

Laus Deo Honor et Gloria!
