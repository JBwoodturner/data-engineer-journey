# Log for Today — 2025-06-19

It's been almost six months since I began this wonderful journey.

On 2025-01-20, I subscribed to DataCamp and started exploring the world of Data. Very soon, I realized I had a passion for building systems and focused on Data Engineering and ETL processes.

Since then, I've been making steady progress in parallel areas: Python scripting, data manipulation with Pandas, Bash fluency, Git and GitHub, SQL, some S3, and now Docker.

I'm preparing for a three-month sprint before my upcoming retreat in Kraków. I've set up a Notion template with the subjects I need to master and the courses I aim to complete beforehand.

I’m ready to keep going — motivated, alive, excited. Every time I struggle with difficulty, I become a stronger and more resilient man.

**Laus Deo, Honor et Gloria!**
