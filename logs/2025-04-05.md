## Quote for the day

“Deus est in omnibus rebus 
per potentiam, 
    inquantum omnia subduntur eius potestati; 
per praesentiam vero, 
    inquantum omnia nuda sunt et aperta oculis eius; 
per essentiam vero, 
    inquantum adest omnibus ut causa essendi, 
    sicut dictum est supra.”
(Summa Theologiae, I, q. 8, a. 3)

“God is in all things 
by His power, 
    inasmuch as all things are subject to His power; 
by His presence, 
    inasmuch as all things are naked and open to His eyes; and 
by His essence, 
    inasmuch as He is present to all as the cause of their being, 
    as was said above.”
