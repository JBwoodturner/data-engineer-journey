### Progress (morning)

- Built structure for `extract_english.py`  and README.md
- Completed the first part of the script, logic is pending.
- Practiced using Git with clean commits. 
- Maintained study habit with two Pomodoros of 45 min each.
- Today´s session felt deeply productive and focused.

## Next Steps

- Begin logic for English extraction.  
- Save raw data to `english_kempis.txt` 
- Combine Latin and English texts into a single bilingual TSV using `combine_texts.py`
- Create one specific README for the Extract Phase, linked to the main README

## Time Spent

- Two 45 min Pomodoros.

## Quote for the day

“Deus est in omnibus rebus 
per potentiam, 
    inquantum omnia subduntur eius potestati; 
per praesentiam vero, 
    inquantum omnia nuda sunt et aperta oculis eius; 
per essentiam vero, 
    inquantum adest omnibus ut causa essendi, 
    sicut dictum est supra.”
(Summa Theologiae, I, q. 8, a. 3)

“God is in all things 
by His power, 
    inasmuch as all things are subject to His power; 
by His presence, 
    inasmuch as all things are naked and open to His eyes; and 
by His essence, 
    inasmuch as He is present to all as the cause of their being, 
    as was said above.”

##Lessons from a Scraper Meltdown

-   Today I worked on the English extraction phase of my ETL project, 
    starting with the CCEL website. I had a clear idea: begin at one link and 
    let the script follow a chain of pages, scraping as it goes. I wanted it to feel 
    like a self-guided web crawler.

## What Went Wrong

The initial script seemed promising, but then things got messy:
- The script grew complex quickly (regex, sessions, URL guessing)
- My machine threw memory errors, even with 16 GB of RAM
- The server started cutting off requests
- I didn’t really understand some of the code I was pasting and running
- And worst of all, the website structure made everything harder than it needed to be

## What I Learned

- Complexity in code isn’t always power — sometimes it’s clutter.
- Scraping isn’t just about code — it’s about choosing a **good source**.
- Project Gutenberg is a *great* alternative: stable, simple, and respectful of readers.
- I can write good, clean code when I slow down and work with the right materials.
- And most importantly: frustration is part of real learning.

## What I’ll Do Differently

- Stick to sources that are built for readers (like Gutenberg)
- Avoid over-engineering in the extract phase
- Stop and reflect when I don’t understand something — ask for clarity
- Write to file incrementally to avoid memory issues
