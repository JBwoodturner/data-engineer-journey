** 2025-04-25 – Data Engineering Journey Log**  
(One month since my first log in GitHub)

**Focus:** DataCamp + ZoomCamp + Supplier Pipeline (v1–v3)

Today I began preparing for the upcoming **6-week focused plan**, which I intend to officially start on **Monday**. The weekend (from today until Sunday) will serve as a **preparation phase**, primarily dedicated to getting oriented with **ZoomCamp** and solidifying key foundational concepts.

**Today's Progress:**  
- Reengaged with the **DataCamp Associate SQL** track.  
- Studied important topics in **data modeling**:
  - **Star Schema** and **Snowflake Schema**
  - **Normalization Theory**: 1NF, 2NF, 3NF  
- Gained insights into when to normalize vs. denormalize data for analytical workloads.

**What's Next:**  
- Continue ZoomCamp prep over the weekend  
- Finish the **Data Modeling & Normalization** modules in DataCamp  
- Organize materials and tasks for the **Supplier Data Pipeline (v1, v2, v3)** project rollout

 **Big Picture:**  
This weekend is about sharpening tools. Monday begins the real march forward. The goal: deepen technical skill, build project mastery, and bring structure to the learning journey. Stay steady and prayerful.


**This is the structure of my 6 weeks Roadmap**
